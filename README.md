Welcome to **Thought Ink** – a lightweight, privacy-focused note-taking app with built-in AI assistance. Designed as a learning project, Thought Ink helps you take structured notes (with headings, bullet points, etc.), store them locally in your browser, and ask AI questions based on your content – all without sending your data to any server.

## ✨ Features

- **Create rich notes** with headings, bullet points, and formatting
- **Notes saved locally** in your browser (no accounts, no servers)
- **Built-in AI assistant** that answers questions based on your notes

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Write Notes**  
   Use a clean editor to take notes in structured format.

2. **Ask Questions**  
   Use the prompt window to ask the AI assistant questions about your notes for instant answers or clarification.

3. **Local Storage**  
   All notes are stored in your browser using `localStorage`. This ensures full privacy, but keep in mind:
   > 🛑 **If you clear your browser cache or data, your notes will be lost!**
